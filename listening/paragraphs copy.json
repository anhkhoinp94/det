    "p": "I recently celebrated my mother's sixtieth birthday party, a milestone that I have been able to honor each year since I started working. This year, I prepared a delicious meal at home instead of going to a restaurant as we usually do. I made Vietnamese fresh spring rolls, which is my mother's favorite dish because of its fresh and light taste. However, I am not skilled at cooking, so my mother helped me to taste and adjust seasoning. My family gathered around to enjoy the meal, and my mother blew out the birthday candles which my brother had bought. The party was simple but filled with warmth, and it made all of us, especially my mother, feel incredibly happy."

    "p": "My former boss has played a crucial role in shaping my career. I deeply admire him for not only his accomplishments but also the support he provided. He is both an outstanding manager and a genuinely compassionate person. When I graduated, he was the only person who took a chance on me for an entry-level position, even though I had no background in information technology. Besides that, he offered me numerous opportunities and challenges that helped me learn and grow professionally. Although I always felt anxious and uncertain because of my limited experience, he encouraged me and boosted my confidence, empowering me to believe in myself and try hard with no fear. Through his guidance, I learned the importance of kindness, and the value of being willing to support others during challenging times."

    "p": "I'm a big fan of soccer and dedicate two hours each weekend to playing matches with my brothers. In my usual game last weekend, I had a standout performance and created a hilarious and unforgettable moment. After a penalty corner from the other team, I intercepted the ball and sprinted towards their goal, passing two defenders skillfully and even getting past the goalkeeper. I made a powerful shot instead of tapping the ball into an empty net. When everyone thought it must be a goal, the ball ricocheted off the goalpost and bounced back into my face. I felt slightly dazed and collapsed onto the ground while teammates laughed. I laughed then although I felt a bit embarrassed, and the moment made our game more enjoyable and memorable."

    "p": "Grandparents' home is the place where I feel most connected. It is where I was born and where I spent my entire childhood. I was deeply loved and cared for by my grandparents when they were still alive. I still vividly remember my grandmother peeling each grape for me, even though they were very expensive at the time and we were very poor, just to encourage me to eat due to my lack of appetite. I also cherish the memory of my grandfather taking my cousins and me for rides on his old bicycle around our house every afternoon after he returned from work. Even though my grandparents have passed away and the house has been rebuilt, it still remains my cherished memories and my deep gratitude."

    "p": "I firmly believe that exploring natural destinations plays an important role in fostering a deeper understanding and care for the environment. First, it allows people to connect with nature, experience its beauty and gain the natural energy that can restore mental health. Personally, I would love to visit a natural place to relax after long periods of working under pressure. Moreover, connecting with nature helps people enrich their knowledge about the environment, the wildlife, and the importance of conservation. However, there should be strict guidelines, rules, and penalties to prevent harm caused by tourists, such as littering, pollution and other damaging activities. In conclusion, nature is not only our home but also provides many essential resources for our lives, so we must conserve and protect it."

    "p": "Technologies are advancing rapidly and having a significant impact on our lives. I am especially impressed by the emergence of ChatGPT or other AI tools. As a software engineer, these tools assist me greatly with research and improve the speed and quality of my work. One technology that does not yet exist or in development but I believe would be incredibly useful in the future is fully autonomous vehicles. These reliable self-driving cars could help to reduce human errors, ease traffic congestion, and provide accessibility for people who are unable to drive. No matter what technology will be invented in the future, I always hope it will enhance our quality of life with peace and fulfillment."

    "p": "Nowadays, companies often use famous individuals, such as actors or singers, to promote their products. I believe that it is one of the most effective ways to capture attention and boost sales. From the actor's perspective, agreeing to endorse a product means they must ensure its real quality to protect their reputation, which, in turn, also helps to enhance the product's credibility. From the customer's perspective, they will be easily drawn to well-known actors, especially those they admire, which also makes them more likely to notice and remember the product. This is an extremely crucial goal for any advertising campaign, because it not only increases the brand recognition but also significantly influences customer's purchasing decisions."

    "p": "I have a deep passion for photography, and I own a camera with an array of lenses to satisfy my interest. I always bring my camera whenever I go on a trip to capture treasured moments for my family, especially my sister. My friends often rely on me to be their photographer at birthday parties and other celebrations. For me, taking pictures is not just a hobby but also a meaningful way to preserve the memories of everyday life. I both enjoy capturing images and admiring the art of photography. I usually spend my free time revisiting new and old photos to relive the moments I have experienced, especially those featuring my grandparents, my beloved family, and my mischievous childhood. These photos leave me with a feeling of pride, happiness, and a deep sense of fulfillment."

  {
    "p": "I utterly agree that people never feel satisfied with what they have. In my perspective, this could bring both advantages and disadvantages. On the positive side, dissatisfaction motivates individuals to endeavor to study or work harder, assisting them in enriching their knowledge and skills. However, if they cannot maintain their balance or healthy mindset, it may have negative effects on their behavior and outlook on life. They can be ready to lose everything such as their happiness and relationships to achieve their goal. I always study how to accept what I have while never stopping improving myself, so that my life can become more peaceful and fulfilling."

    "p": "As a software engineer, I always need to learn new technologies to stay up to date. Once, I had only three days to prepare for a new project that required a tool that was utterly new to me. The documentation was long, and my reading skills weren't very strong, which made it challenging. I spent over five hours each night after work reading through the documentation carefully, watching youtube tutorials, looking up best practices, and building sample implementations to get hands-on experience. Although integrating the code with the new tool took extra time to enhance, I still kept the process on schedule and ensured everything worked smoothly. In conclusion, achieving the target in such a short time was always difficult but incredibly interesting, and I felt really happy when I finished it."

    "p": "Slam Dunk is one of the most inspiring comic series I read when I was a child. It tells the story of a mischievous youngster with red hair, starting playing basketball when he joined in high school. Although he began as a complete beginner, he dedicated himself to studying and practicing hard to become a professional player. His consistency and dedication from a clumsy, inexperienced player to a skilled athlete, no matter how challenging it gets, is what I love the most in this film and it taught me to always give my best effort. Moreover, his stubbornness and playful personality bring a lot of humor and lightness to the story. The way he faces each challenge on and off the court shows different sides of his character, making him feel real and easy to relate to. However, the story ended when he graduated. I, along with many fans, hope the author will release the next season someday. It would be amazing to follow his next steps, perhaps facing bigger challenges. And I believe many eager viewers are looking forward to following the boy's new journey."

    "p": "Nowadays, lots of well-known people such as athletes, singers, and actors use social media to interact with their fans. I admire Mr.Do, one of the most renowned streamers in Vietnam, and I usually spend hours at night watching his shows. One of the most memorable stories he shared with his audience was about how he overcame the difficulties of a painful breakup. His story not only teaches the youngsters how to face and solve the problems in their lives, but also brings various positive perspectives. In conclusion, his openness both entertains and provides valuable life lessons to encourage his viewers to live optimistically."

    "p": "From my perspective, decorating a home is interesting and it can bring both advantages and disadvantages. Home decoration can transform the ambience, making it more colorful, peaceful, and cozier. It not only reflects the owner's style and personality but also helps them feel at ease and relieve stress after a long working day. However, using inappropriate decorations, such as large items that waste space or overcrowding the space with too many decorative pieces, can result in a lack of sophistication and an overall messy appearance. In my perspective, while decoration can enhance the atmosphere of a home, it's important to select suitable pieces or items to sustain a balanced living space, such as soft lanterns, miniature plants, and tasteful artwork."

    "p": "I utterly agree that patience is an extremely vital key to reaching goals. Without patience, goals will never become reality. Personally, when I graduated, I aspired to become an excellent developer, but I encountered numerous challenges from the outset, including several rejections due to my lack of experience in information technology. However, I remained persistent and fortunately received a magnificent opportunity from my former boss whom I deeply admire. I seized that opportunity and constantly gave my best efforts, which ultimately led to my current success. Even now, I continue to actively pursue learning and improvement, knowing that through patience and persistence, I can only get better."

    "p": "When I need to learn something, I prefer having someone to support me or, at least, provide me with some advice or guidance. A person with knowledge and experience in the field is capable of offering simpler instructions that make it easier to understand. Alternatively, if they don't have much time to explain in detail, they can suggest easier ways to approach the topic, such as providing an overview, sharing key concepts, or recommending easily accessible resources. However, it's not always possible to find someone with the specific knowledge you need or who is willing to share their expertise with you. I greatly value having someone's guidance, but I recognize that I must dedicate myself and work independently to improve my knowledge and skills."

  {
    "p": "I truly believe that writing skills are essential in almost every field, particularly in creative industries such as marketing, publishing, and law. Schools should actively support the development of students' writing abilities, which are fundamental not only for communication, but also for fostering critical thinking and creativity. Even in technical fields, the ability to write clearly is indispensable for preparing clear reports, well-written emails, and effective presentations. However, it is equally important to develop technical skills, as the rapid advancement of technology necessitates that both adults and students stay up to date and avoid falling behind. From my perspective, students should be taught all subjects in a balanced way, with equal emphasis on both writing and technical training. This comprehensive approach would better equip them for the future, helping them become well-prepared, confident, and adaptable for the challenges ahead."

    "p": "Nowadays, technologies are advancing at a rapid pace, and in specific fields like education, they offer a wealth of tools and digital resources that make knowledge more accessible. I entirely believe that digital resources can utterly replace traditional paper textbooks. With just a computer or smartphone connected to the internet, students can access information across a wide range of subjects and even take notes or write directly on these devices. Moreover, shifting from paper to digital resources can help reduce the wood consumption and contribute to environmental sustainability. However, from a social perspective, there are some disadvantages associated with using digital resources for learning such as increased eye strain, diminished attention span, or limited access for those with financial difficulties. To address these challenges, schools should adopt a hybrid approach, combining traditional and digital methods in teaching will help students learn effectively and grow meaningfully."

  {
    "p": "I entirely agree that the demand for multilingual employees will remain increasing with globalization. Many big companies, such as Unilever and Amazon, actively seek or hire individuals who are proficient in multiple languages to better serve their customers across different markets. For example, an employee who can speak both English and Chinese fluently would be well-suited for Asian markets and could gain a competitive edge and more opportunities to enhance their career path. Moreover, in fields such as tourism or diplomacy, the ability to communicate in multiple languages facilitates building relationships and resolving conflicts more effectively. Therefore, I firmly believe that in the future, multilingual proficiency will not merely be an advantage, but a mandatory requirement for success in an international working environment."

    "p": "Some part-time jobs that I believe are suitable for high school students include working as coffee shop servers, tutors, or sales staff. One of the main reasons is that these jobs do not require extensive prior experience or significant physical strength, and they offer flexible working schedules that accommodate students' academic commitments. This flexibility allows students not only to earn an income but also to develop valuable skills and broaden their perspectives. For example, being a tutor enables students to reinforce their academic knowledge and enhance their communication skills. Similarly, working in a coffee shop equips them with customer service expertise, teamwork experience, and the ability to manage their time effectively in a dynamic environment. The flexibility and non-stressful work environment enable students to balance study and work, while also preparing for the demands of the working world."

    "p": "From my perspective, I prefer paintings which contain clear messages because the artists convey their ideas directly and effectively. This type of art often evokes powerful emotions or highlights significant contents or social issues, making it easier for viewers to grasp the artist's intentions and standpoint. For example, once I came across the picture of a child holding a peace sign in a war zone, vividly underscored humanity's universal desire for peace. In contrast, abstract art, which can sometimes be ambiguous or challenging to interpret, so art with a clear message appeals to a broader audience. Even though they are different, I deeply appreciate the diversity of artistic expression, as all forms of art contribute emotional and intellectual depth."

    "p": "Perseverance is one of the most valuable lessons I've learned outside of the classroom. I've always been interested in riding a bicycle, but I faced significant challenges learning and practicing due to my knee problem when I was an infant. It caused pain and discouragement, making me want to give up. However, with my mother's encouragement and my own determination, I refused to quit and succeeded eventually. I realized that perseverance and consistent effort are key to reaching the goals I set, or at least gaining valuable lessons. Now, I apply this lesson across various areas of my life, especially in my studies, which has helped me absorb a lot of knowledge and enhance my skills."

  {
    "p": "I strongly disagree with the practice of some museums and documentary filmmakers trying to make the historical stories more interesting than they actually are. History is about real events that truly occurred in the past and that provide genuine lessons and values for the present. Even if a historical story is not particularly interesting or entertaining, it still holds the power of truth, allowing the audience to understand it more deeply and meaningfully. Making history more interesting can not only seriously harm the general public's perception but also reflect a lack of respect for the people and events of the past. From my perspective, historical stories must always be accurate and faithfully reflect the truth."
  },
  {
    "p": "I utterly agree that many people are passionate about museums because of the rich experiences they offer. Visiting museums provides opportunities to learn directly from artifacts and displays, connecting theoretical knowledge from books with reality. Exhibitions enable viewers to better understand various aspects of history, science, and art. Personally, I have visited the Vietnam History Museum many times, which has helped me deeply understand historical periods, particularly struggles Vietnamese people faced during wars to protect our country. This experience makes me always proud to be Vietnamese and fosters a deeper love for our nation and its people. From my perspective, museums are not only places to preserve the past, but also serve as a source of inspiration for the future."

    "p": "From my perspective, socializing has both advantages and disadvantages. One major advantage is that it helps build strong relationships, creates opportunities for collaboration, and improves mental health. However, socializing can sometimes be time-consuming, tiring, or even lead to conflicts. Personally, I have experienced both positive and negative social interactions. I have good friends who help me relax and learn new things. On the other hand, I have had some bad relationships that caused me a lot of trouble, and I always try to keep my distance from them. When I socialize, I try to be sociable and a good listener to make others feel respected, as I believe that respecting others helps me maintain good relationships."

    "p": "A valuable life lesson I learned from my mistakes is about humility. In the past, I was very arrogant and overconfident about my math skills, because I was a member of the school's math team. However, my overconfidence led me to neglect reviewing my lessons and skipping my homework. During one test, I couldn't remember the solution and failed to finish the exam, which resulted in my first C grade. My parents scolded me, and I felt deeply disappointed in myself. After that experience, I realized that no matter how talented I may be, I need to remain humble and always give my best effort. This experience helped me become more disciplined and responsible."
  },
  {
    "p": "From my perspective, I prefer to preserve historical architectures rather than creating new designs because they bring various valuable contributions. Historical buildings are symbols of a country's culture and history, so preserving these structures is crucial for maintaining spiritual and cultural values. For example, Notre Dame Cathedral in Ho Chi Minh City is not only a magnificent architecture but also a significant symbol of Vietnamese history, culture, and national identity. In addition, historical buildings are not only attractive destinations for tourists but can also help stimulate the local economy. In short, I believe historical buildings play a crucial role in preserving cultural values, educating future generations and boosting local economies."

    "p": "My job often makes me feel stressed, overwhelmed, and exhausted, so I regularly engage in activities that help me relax and recharge. For instance, I enjoy reading books because it not only broadens my knowledge but also provides a sense of tranquility. Diving into interesting stories or absorbing meaningful lessons allows me to temporarily forget the pressures of daily life. Additionally, I maintain my well-being through physical activities such as jogging. Exercising helps me release tension and boosts my body and mind. Sweating during exercise makes me feel like my worries are fading away. Sometimes, I feel comforted when I listen to my favorite music. Whether it's soft melodies or lively beats, music helps me restore balance and regain positive energy. Another activity I love is riding my motorbike around the city. Seeing the busy streets, lush trees, and enjoying the fresh air while on the move helps me relax and feel refreshed. Depending on my mood and circumstances, I choose the activity that best helps me alleviate stress and regain energy."

    "p": "Text messaging has brought many benefits to human communication by allowing us to communicate quickly and efficiently. Compared to traditional phone calls or letters, texting enables users to exchange information almost instantly. With mobile phones, we can send and receive messages anytime and anywhere, helping us stay connected, whether we're far apart or busy. In addition, today's text messages are not limited to just words, as they can also include images, videos, emojis, and links, making communication more interactive and engaging. However, text messaging also has limitations such as the lack of gestures and tone, which can sometimes lead to misunderstandings. Therefore, I believe that combining text messaging with other forms of communication will help improve the quality of our connections."

    "p": "Last summer, my family and I went to a peaceful beach. In the afternoon, I walked along the soft and warm sand and stopped to watch the sunset over the sea. Standing there in silence, I felt as if time had paused. The sky changed from orange to pink, with the light reflecting off the water, creating a serene and beautiful scene. The cool, fresh breeze made me feel calm and relaxed, easing the stress and exhaustion from long periods of working under pressure. My family also enjoyed the scenery together, chatting and taking photos to capture the moment. It was a wonderful experience that helped me cherish the precious times spent with my loved ones."

    "p": "My favorite dish is Vietnamese fresh spring rolls. I love this dish because it is fresh, healthy, and full of flavor. The combination of raw vegetables like lettuce and basil, along with shrimp and pork, creates a refreshingly satisfying meal, perfect for modern lifestyle. Making spring rolls is quite simple. First, I boil the shrimp and pork, then slice the pork into thin pieces. The vegetables are thoroughly washed. Using rice paper, I place the ingredients inside and roll them tightly. Spring rolls are best served with sweet and sour fish sauce, with garlic and chili added to create a rich flavor. This dish is not only typical of Vietnamese cuisine but also holds significant family memories. I always cherish the times when the whole family gathered to prepare and enjoy spring rolls, creating a warm and happy ambience."

    "p": "Lunar New Year is my favorite tradition. It is a special occasion filled with various meaningful activities such as visiting relatives, giving lucky money, and participating in traditional events like fireworks and lion dances. In preparation, my family comes together to clean and decorate our house with the hope of much fortune. During the celebration, I often go to church to pray for a year filled with peace, happiness, and success in both life and work. My family and I also prepare traditional dishes and enjoy them together. This festival is very important to me because it allows the entire family to come together after a year of hard work. These warm and meaningful moments make me feel proud and deepen my love for the traditions of my hometown."

    "p": "I completely agree that online advertising is one of the fastest and most effective ways to promote products and services. Nowadays, the internet is widely used and offers many supporting platforms, making it easy for ads to reach a large audience at a reasonable cost. This has made it one of the most preferred methods for businesses' marketing efforts. However, the increasing number of online scams has made users more cautious about digital ads. This is a challenge for advertisers, because trust is a crucial factor in building long-term relationships. In my opinion, to gain customer trust, businesses must not only invest in online advertising but also ensure the quality of their products and services."

In the evening, I play soccer with my brothers, which is both entertaining and a good way to exercise. Every Sunday morning, I go to church with my family to pray for a peaceful and joyful week. In addition, I often help my mother prepare delicious dishes at home. For me, the perfect weekend is simple but filled with enjoyable moments because I can spend time with my loved ones, relax, and join in activities that bring both health and happiness."

    "p": "I entirely agree that universities should encourage students to study a full range of subjects rather than focusing on just one. A diverse curriculum helps students acquire broader knowledge applicable to different jobs, giving them a significant advantage in the competitive job market. Moreover, in a rapidly changing world, learning multiple subjects allows students to adapt more easily and switch careers if needed. For instance, students who study accounting but also learn marketing can easily find jobs in many fields, from banking to sales, or even start their own businesses. I believe that if students focus on just one subject, they may find it difficult to adapt to the evolving job market."
  },
  {
    "p": "In the future, I believe there will be many types of small businesses that young people can start. One example is running online stores and selling on platforms like Shopee and Amazon. This helps save costs of opening a physical store while easily reaching global customers. They could sell homemade products, clothes, cosmetics, or unique items they create. Additionally, with the development of technology, young people will be able to start businesses in various sectors. They can create applications, games, software, or artificial intelligence tools to solve social or environmental problems or support other businesses. Young people today are becoming more confident, enthusiastic and creative, so I believe there will be a wide variety of businesses in the future."

  {
    "p": "I entirely disagree with the idea that children should learn foreign languages at an early age. Learning a new language too early, when children are not yet familiar with their mother tongue, can lead to language confusion. Young learners may find it difficult to distinguish between languages, which could slow down or affect the accuracy of language development. In my opinion, children should start learning another language from the age of 7. By this age, they have a strong foundation in their mother tongue and improved cognitive abilities, making it easier to learn a new language effectively and naturally. Therefore, I think the timing of starting to learn a second language should be carefully considered to support children's development."

    "p": "Currently, I have various hobbies such as playing sports, learning musical instruments, studying English, and exploring new technologies. These activities not only help me relax but also bring significant value to my life. In the coming year, I think I will dedicate more time to focus on technology learning, as the projects I am working on have gradually stabilized. For me, embracing new technologies is not only a hobby but also a crucial skill that helps me absorb a lot of knowledge in the field. In the next 5 years, I believe gaining technological knowledge will no longer be just a hobby but an essential requirement for my career path, as technologies are advancing rapidly and I strive to stay up to date."

    "p": "I usually avoid trying new things, but one experience changed my perspective. As a software engineer, I tend to avoid unfamiliar tools, especially those I don't really trust. When ChatGPT was first released, I thought it was unreliable and had no plans of using it. However, during a critical project, I encountered a major issue. Running out of time and options, I decided to give ChatGPT a try. To my surprise, it quickly provided an accurate and effective solution, helping me complete the project on schedule. Since then, I have used ChatGPT regularly as a personal assistant, significantly enhancing speed and quality of my work. This experience taught me that stepping out of my comfort zone and trying new things can lead to unexpected and valuable results."

This site is where a significant event took place on April 30, 1975. On that day, tanks of the Vietnam People's Army entered the palace, marking the end of the Vietnam War and the reunification of the country. Today, the Independence Palace is not only a symbol of peace and national unity but also a repository for numerous valuable artifacts and documents. These historical items reflect the struggles and sacrifices of the Vietnamese people during their fight to protect and reunify the nation."

    "p": "In my perspective, friendships can come to an end for various reasons. One of the main reasons is the different paths each individual takes in life. As people progress through different stages, they may develop new interests, goals and values, which can make them incompatible with one another. Moreover, unresolved conflicts and misunderstandings often play a significant role in the breakdown of relationships. When these issues remain unresolved, they can lead to emotional distance between friends. Finally, various external factors such as work pressures, family responsibilities, or social expectations can cause friendships to be neglected or gradually fade over time."

It provides us with the knowledge and skills needed to achieve our career goals and build a stable future, especially by fostering critical thinking and creativity. A well-educated person is likely to have more job opportunities and enjoy a more secure life. That's why I always strive to learn new things and continuously improve myself. Moreover, education helps me better understand the world and society, guiding me on how to behave responsibly towards my family and community. From my perspective, education is not only about gaining knowledge, but also about shaping our character and preparing us to contribute to a better future."

It is reflected in treating everyone equally and ensuring that all individuals have the same opportunities. This fosters a sense of respect and belonging, enhancing connections among people. Personally, I feel more motivated at work when I know I am being treated fairly. Moreover, fairness plays a crucial role in preventing conflicts and misunderstandings, helping to build a more united community. That's why I always try to be fair in every situation. From my perspective, fairness is not just a guideline for human interactions but also a key factor in creating a better world."
