    "p": "Nowadays, companies often use famous individuals, such as actors or singers, to promote their products.\n\nI believe that it is one of the most effective ways to capture attention and boost sales.\n\nFrom the actor's perspective, agreeing to endorse a product means they must ensure its real quality to protect their reputation, which, in turn, also helps to enhance the product's credibility.\n\nFrom the customer's perspective, they will be easily drawn to well-known actors, especially those they admire, which also makes them more likely to notice and remember the product.\n\nThis is an extremely crucial goal for any advertising campaign, because it not only increases the brand recognition but also significantly influences customer's purchasing decisions."

    "p": "Nowadays, technologies are advancing at a rapid pace, and in specific fields like education, they offer a wealth of tools and digital resources that make knowledge more accessible.\n\nI entirely believe that digital resources can utterly replace traditional paper textbooks.\n\nWith just a computer or smartphone connected to the internet, students can access information across a wide range of subjects and even take notes or write directly on these devices.\n\nMoreover, shifting from paper to digital resources can help reduce the wood consumption and contribute to environmental sustainability.\n\nHowever, from a social perspective, there are some disadvantages associated with using digital resources for learning such as increased eye strain, diminished attention span, or limited access for those with financial difficulties.\n\nTo address these challenges, schools should adopt a hybrid approach, combining traditional and digital methods in teaching will help students learn effectively and grow meaningfully."

    "p": "I entirely agree that the demand for multilingual employees will remain increasing with globalization.\n\nMany big companies, such as Unilever and Amazon, actively seek or hire individuals who are proficient in multiple languages to better serve their customers across different markets.\n\nFor example, an employee who can speak both English and Chinese fluently would be well-suited for Asian markets and could gain a competitive edge and more opportunities to enhance their career path.\n\nMoreover, in fields such as tourism or diplomacy, the ability to communicate in multiple languages facilitates building relationships and resolving conflicts more effectively.\n\nTherefore, I firmly believe that in the future, multilingual proficiency will not merely be an advantage, but a mandatory requirement for success in an international working environment."

    "p": "Some part-time jobs that I believe are suitable for high school students include working as coffee shop servers, tutors, or sales staff.\n\nOne of the main reasons is that these jobs do not require extensive prior experience or significant physical strength, and they offer flexible working schedules that accommodate students' academic commitments.\n\nThis flexibility allows students not only to earn an income but also to develop valuable skills and broaden their perspectives.\n\nFor example, being a tutor enables students to reinforce their academic knowledge and enhance their communication skills.\n\nSimilarly, working in a coffee shop equips them with customer service expertise, teamwork experience, and the ability to manage their time effectively in a dynamic environment.\n\nThe flexibility and non-stressful work environment enable students to balance study and work, while also preparing for the demands of the working world."

    "p": "From my perspective, I prefer paintings which contain clear messages because the artists convey their ideas directly and effectively.\n\nThis type of art often evokes powerful emotions or highlights significant contents or social issues, making it easier for viewers to grasp the artist's intentions and standpoint.\n\nFor example, once I came across the picture of a child holding a peace sign in a war zone, vividly underscored humanity's universal desire for peace.\n\nIn contrast, abstract art, which can sometimes be ambiguous or challenging to interpret, so art with a clear message appeals to a broader audience.\n\nEven though they are different, I deeply appreciate the diversity of artistic expression, as all forms of art contribute emotional and intellectual depth."

  {
    "p": "I strongly disagree with the practice of some museums and documentary filmmakers trying to make the historical stories more interesting than they actually are.\n\nHistory is about real events that truly occurred in the past and that provide genuine lessons and values for the present.\n\nEven if a historical story is not particularly interesting or entertaining, it still holds the power of truth, allowing the audience to understand it more deeply and meaningfully.\n\nMaking history more interesting can not only seriously harm the general public's perception but also reflect a lack of respect for the people and events of the past.\n\nFrom my perspective, historical stories must always be accurate and faithfully reflect the truth."
  },
  {
    "p": "I utterly agree that many people are passionate about museums because of the rich experiences they offer.\n\nVisiting museums provides opportunities to learn directly from artifacts and displays, connecting theoretical knowledge from books with reality.\n\nExhibitions enable viewers to better understand various aspects of history, science, and art.\n\nPersonally, I have visited the Vietnam History Museum many times, which has helped me deeply understand historical periods, particularly struggles Vietnamese people faced during wars to protect our country.\n\nThis experience makes me always proud to be Vietnamese and fosters a deeper love for our nation and its people.\n\nFrom my perspective, museums are not only places to preserve the past, but also serve as a source of inspiration for the future."

    "p": "From my perspective, socializing has both advantages and disadvantages.\n\nOne major advantage is that it helps build strong relationships, creates opportunities for collaboration, and improves mental health.\n\nHowever, socializing can sometimes be time-consuming, tiring, or even lead to conflicts.\n\nPersonally, I have experienced both positive and negative social interactions.\n\nI have good friends who help me relax and learn new things.\n\nOn the other hand, I have had some bad relationships that caused me a lot of trouble, and I always try to keep my distance from them.\n\nWhen I socialize, I try to be sociable and a good listener to make others feel respected, as I believe that respecting others helps me maintain good relationships."

    "p": "A valuable life lesson I learned from my mistakes is about humility.\n\nIn the past, I was very arrogant and overconfident about my math skills, because I was a member of the school's math team.\n\nHowever, my overconfidence led me to neglect reviewing my lessons and skipping my homework.\n\nDuring one test, I couldn't remember the solution and failed to finish the exam, which resulted in my first C grade.\n\nMy parents scolded me, and I felt deeply disappointed in myself.\n\nAfter that experience, I realized that no matter how talented I may be, I need to remain humble and always give my best effort.\n\nThis experience helped me become more disciplined and responsible."
  },
  {
    "p": "From my perspective, I prefer to preserve historical architectures rather than creating new designs because they bring various valuable contributions.\n\nHistorical buildings are symbols of a country's culture and history, so preserving these structures is crucial for maintaining spiritual and cultural values.\n\nFor example, Notre Dame Cathedral in Ho Chi Minh City is not only a magnificent architecture but also a significant symbol of Vietnamese history, culture, and national identity.\n\nIn addition, historical buildings are not only attractive destinations for tourists but can also help stimulate the local economy.\n\nIn short, I believe historical buildings play a crucial role in preserving cultural values, educating future generations and boosting local economies."

    "p": "Text messaging has brought many benefits to human communication by allowing us to communicate quickly and efficiently.\n\nCompared to traditional phone calls or letters, texting enables users to exchange information almost instantly.\n\nWith mobile phones, we can send and receive messages anytime and anywhere, helping us stay connected, whether we're far apart or busy.\n\nIn addition, today's text messages are not limited to just words, as they can also include images, videos, emojis, and links, making communication more interactive and engaging.\n\nHowever, text messaging also has limitations such as the lack of gestures and tone, which can sometimes lead to misunderstandings.\n\nTherefore, I believe that combining text messaging with other forms of communication will help improve the quality of our connections."

    "p": "I entirely agree that universities should encourage students to study a full range of subjects rather than focusing on just one.\n\nA diverse curriculum helps students acquire broader knowledge applicable to different jobs, giving them a significant advantage in the competitive job market.\n\nMoreover, in a rapidly changing world, learning multiple subjects allows students to adapt more easily and switch careers if needed.\n\nFor instance, students who study accounting but also learn marketing can easily find jobs in many fields, from banking to sales, or even start their own businesses.\n\nI believe that if students focus on just one subject, they may find it difficult to adapt to the evolving job market."

  {
    "p": "In the future, I believe there will be many types of small businesses that young people can start.\n\nOne example is running online stores and selling on platforms like Shopee and Amazon.\n\nThis helps save costs of opening a physical store while easily reaching global customers.\n\nThey could sell homemade products, clothes, cosmetics, or unique items they create.\n\nAdditionally, with the development of technology, young people will be able to start businesses in various sectors.\n\nThey can create applications, games, software, or artificial intelligence tools to solve social or environmental problems or support other businesses.\n\nYoung people today are becoming more confident, enthusiastic and creative, so I believe there will be a wide variety of businesses in the future."

    "p": "I entirely disagree with the idea that children should learn foreign languages at an early age.\n\nLearning a new language too early, when children are not yet familiar with their mother tongue, can lead to language confusion.\n\nYoung learners may find it difficult to distinguish between languages, which could slow down or affect the accuracy of language development.\n\nIn my opinion, children should start learning another language from the age of 7.\n\nBy this age, they have a strong foundation in their mother tongue and improved cognitive abilities, making it easier to learn a new language effectively and naturally.\n\nTherefore, I think the timing of starting to learn a second language should be carefully considered to support children's development."

    "p": "I truly believe that protecting our online identity is incredibly important.\n\nStaying anonymous helps safeguard personal information, preventing criminals from stealing data, committing fraud, or even taking control of our online and bank accounts.\n\nAs social media grows, the risk of losing personal information has become more serious and harder to manage.\n\nIn my opinion, people should only share necessary details based on the platform they're using to minimize risks.\n\nAdditionally, using security tools like strong passwords and two-factor authentication is essential to protect personal data.\n\nMoreover, learning about online safety and cyber threats helps people protect themselves in an increasingly dangerous digital world.\n\nBy keeping our information private and secure, we can feel safer and more confident when using the internet."

    "p": "From my perspective, a good leader plays an extremely important role because they not only have a clear vision but also know how to inspire and bring people together.\n\nGood leadership can be seen clearly in the stability and sustainable growth of an organization, or even a country.\n\nA nation led by individuals with integrity and empathy can build trust among the people, which helps promote economic and social progress.\n\nWhen people trust and readily support their leader, it's easier to implement policies that improve education, healthcare, and protect the environment.\n\nMoreover, strong leadership also enhances the country's position in the international arena, creating favorable conditions for cooperation and development.\n\nTherefore, I firmly believe that a good leader is essential for a country's prosperity and success."
